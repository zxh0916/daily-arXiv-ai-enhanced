Within the simulation, an\nautonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself\nstrategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to\napproach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the\nshooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction\nmethod, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to\nsiren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,\nhigh-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a\nno-robot control.

The lightweight structure, which\nrequires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to\nother grippers.

Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four\nmulti-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates\nsignificantly more diverse datasets than existing methods.

However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often\nnon-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the\nCBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a\nconservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a\nline/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when\ndeciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative\nconstraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.\nThus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with\nrespect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to\nget as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety\nguarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least\nrestrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth\nparameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the\napproach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,\nmoving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles."}

However,\ntraditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and\npotentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as\ncrater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that\ncompares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding\nlocomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions\nand speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT\ncurves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions\nbetween the two strategies.

While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched\nrobotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between\nspatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event\nwashing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a\nframework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This\nrepresentation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex\nspatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's\ncapability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human\ninquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG\nframework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:\nhttps://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG."}

Barfoot"], "title": "Sharing the Load: Distributed Model-Predictive Control for Precise Multi-Rover Cargo Transport", "comment": "8 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more\noperational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,\nprecision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this\nmotivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for\nmulti-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of\nlidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a\nEuclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.\nOur approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other\nwithout GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized\nMPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.\nThe distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex\ncentralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between\nthe leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range\nscenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility\nprovided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real\ndeployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km\nof driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the\nproposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying\nto maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions."}

Physics-informed deep learning is able\nto overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate\nconvergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of\nself-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that\nenriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the\nnature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and\nsolution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems\nand simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial\nDeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum\ndifferential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding\noptimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies\nfor worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional\nsimulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that\nour approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in\nsimulation and produces impressive results in hardware."}
