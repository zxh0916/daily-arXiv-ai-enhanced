Motivation: 传统四旋翼无人机是欠驱动的，无法实现六自由度的独立控制。现有全向四旋翼设计通常需要大幅结构改造，而本设计旨在提供轻量化、易于集成的解决方案。

Conclusion: 万向节转子机构为构建全向四旋翼提供了一种模块化且高效的解决方案，实现了全驱动控制能力。

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a gimballed rotor mechanism as a modular and efficient solution for constructing omnidirectional quadrotors. Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Debasmita Ghose,Oz Gitelson,Ryan Jin,Grace Abawe,Marynel Vazquez,Brian Scassellati*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种检测人类目标变化的方法，通过跟踪多个候选动作序列并与策略库验证其合理性。检测到目标变化后，机器人重新评估相关历史动作，并使用Receding Horizon Planning树选择既能协助人类又能揭示更新目标的行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实人机协作场景中，人类经常在任务中途改变目标，而现有方法通常假设固定目标，无法适应这种动态变化，导致协作效率降低。

Method: 1) 跟踪多个候选动作序列并验证其合理性；2) 检测到目标变化后重新评估历史动作；3) 构建Receding Horizon Planning树选择既能协助又能揭示更新目标的行动。

Result: 在包含30种独特食谱的协作烹饪环境中评估，该方法优于三种可比的人类目标预测算法，在目标切换后快速收敛到正确目标，减少任务完成时间，提高协作效率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测和适应人类目标的变化，显著提升人机协作的动态适应能力和整体效率。

Abstract: For effective human-robot collaboration, a robot must align its actions with human goals, even as they change mid-task. Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time, and improving collaboration efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人日益融入日常生活环境，理解它们如何与人类沟通变得至关重要。声音提供了一个强大的交互渠道，包括操作噪音和有意设计的听觉提示。

Method: 通过定位和交接任务，研究了Kinova Gen3机械臂的结果性声音和功能性声音对人类感知和行为的影响，特别探索了空间声音的作用。

Result: Kinova Gen3机械臂的结果性声音没有负面影响感知；侧向提示的空间定位高度准确，但正向提示的准确性下降；空间声音可以同时传达任务相关信息，同时促进温暖感并减少不适。

Conclusion: 功能性和变革性听觉设计具有增强人机协作的潜力，为未来基于声音的交互策略提供了信息。

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into everyday environments, understanding how they communicate with humans is critical. Sound offers a powerful channel for interaction, encompassing both operational noises and intentionally designed auditory cues. In this study, we examined the effects of consequential and functional sounds on human perception and behavior, including a novel exploration of spatial sound through localization and handover tasks. Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort. These findings highlight the potential of functional and transformative auditory design to enhance human-robot collaboration and inform future sound-based interaction strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多机器人协作推动任意形状物体到目标位置的方法，解决了复杂环境中非抓取操作的问题，通过组合混合优化实现动态任务分配和混合执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器人没有配备机械手，许多物体不适合抓取操作（如大箱子和圆柱体）。在这些情况下，推动是一种简单而有效的非抓取技能，用于机器人交互并改变环境。现有工作通常假设一组预定义的推动模式和固定形状物体。

Result: 在不同机器人数量和一般形状物体下，框架的效率和有效性在仿真和硬件实验中得到了广泛验证，并推广到异构机器人、平面装配和6D推动。

Conclusion: 该框架在温和假设下是完整的，能够有效解决多机器人协作推动任意形状物体的问题，提高了规划效率并适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general-shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing.

### [5] [Semantic Glitch: Agency and Artistry in an Autonomous Pixel Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16048)
*Qing Zhang,Jing Huang,Mingyang Xu,Jun Rekimoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"低精度"的软体飞行机器人艺术装置"语义故障"，通过多模态大语言模型的语义理解进行导航，创造具有生物启发个性的机器人，强调角色塑造而非效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索故意"低精度"方法的创造潜力，拒绝传统传感器，依赖语义理解来导航，创造具有叙事思维的机器人伴侣。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的自主管道，仅使用多模态大语言模型的定性语义理解进行导航，通过自然语言提示为机器人创作生物启发个性。

Result: 通过13分钟自主飞行日志和后续研究验证了框架的鲁棒性，展示了从地标导航到"计划到执行"差距等涌现行为。

Conclusion: 展示了一个低精度框架，用于创造不完美的伴侣，其成功以角色塑造而非效率来衡量。

Abstract: While mainstream robotics pursues metric precision and flawless performance, this paper explores the creative potential of a deliberately "lo-fi" approach. We present the "Semantic Glitch," a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a "physical glitch" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a "narrative mind" that complements the "weak," historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling "plan to execution" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bi-AQUA是首个基于双边控制的水下模仿学习框架，通过三层光照适应机制解决水下机器人操作中的极端光照变化问题，在真实水下拾取任务中表现出色。

Result: 在真实世界水下拾取任务中，Bi-AQUA在多样静态和动态光照条件下实现了稳健性能，显著优于没有光照建模的双边基线。消融研究证实所有三个光照感知组件都至关重要。

Conclusion: 这项工作连接了陆地双边控制模仿学习与水下操作，使在挑战性海洋环境中进行力敏感自主操作成为可能。

Abstract: Underwater robotic manipulation is fundamentally challenged by extreme lighting variations, color distortion, and reduced visibility. We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is about to revolutionize in-machine material flow in industrial automation. Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

### [8] [FT-NCFM: An Influence-Aware Data Distillation Framework for Efficient VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16233)

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 解决视觉-语言-动作模型对大规模、冗余且价值不均数据集的过度依赖问题，现有模型中心优化方法无法从根本上应对这一数据层面的挑战。

Method: 采用包含事实追踪引擎的FT-NCFM框架，结合因果归因和程序化对比验证来评估样本内在价值，并通过对抗性NCFM过程合成模型无关、信息密集且可重用的数据资产。

Result: 在多个主流VLA基准测试中，仅使用5%蒸馏核心集训练的模型达到完整数据集85-90%的成功率，训练时间减少80%以上。

Conclusion: 智能数据蒸馏是构建高效高性能VLA模型的一条极具前景的新路径。

Abstract: The powerful generalization of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by their heavy reliance on massive, redundant, and unevenly valued datasets, hindering their widespread application. Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.

Conclusion: 这项研究连接了动物行为和机器人技术，表明用于合成孔径传感的摇摆运动是在复杂、杂乱环境中实现高级场景理解的关键。

Abstract: Peering, a side-to-side motion used by animals to estimate distance through motion parallax, offers a powerful bio-inspired strategy to overcome a fundamental limitation in robotic vision: partial occlusion. Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.

### [10] [Funabot-Upper: McKibben Actuated Haptic Suit Inducing Kinesthetic Perceptions in Trunk, Shoulder, Elbow, and Wrist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16265)
*Haru Fukatsu,Ryoji Yasuda,Yuki Funabora,Shinji Doki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Funabot-Upper是一种可穿戴触觉套装，能够感知14种上半身动作，通过独立刺激关节和肌肉来减少感知混淆，相比前代产品将识别准确率从68.8%提升到94.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可穿戴触觉设备主要针对单一身体部位进行验证，很少将相同方法应用于多个身体部位。之前的研究中，肩部和肘部之间存在感知混淆问题，需要开发新的设计策略来解决这些问题。

Method: 建立新的简化设计策略，开发新型触觉套装，通过独立刺激关节和肌肉来诱导躯干、肩部、肘部和腕部的动觉感知。实验验证了诱导的动觉感知，并研究了刺激与感知动觉之间的关系。

Abstract: This paper presents Funabot-Upper, a wearable haptic suit that enables users to perceive 14 upper-body motions, including those of the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.

### [11] [Safe and Optimal Variable Impedance Control via Certified Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16330)
*Shreyas Kumar,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了C-GMS框架，通过采样稳定增益流形来学习DMP和VIC策略，确保Lyapunov稳定性和执行器可行性，消除奖励惩罚需求，并在仿真和真实机器人上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无模型强化学习在机器人技能学习中存在不稳定和不安全探索的风险，特别是由于阻抗增益的时变特性。

Method: 引入认证高斯流形采样(C-GMS)框架，将策略探索重新定义为从数学定义的稳定增益流形中采样，确保每个策略rollout都稳定且物理可实现。

Result: C-GMS在仿真和真实机器人上证明了有效性，为复杂环境中的可靠自主交互铺平道路。

Conclusion: C-GMS提供了一种保证稳定性和物理可行性的轨迹中心强化学习框架，即使在存在有界模型误差和部署时不确定性的情况下也能确保有界跟踪误差。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful approach for robots to learn complex, collaborative skills by combining Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for motion and Variable Impedance Control (VIC) for compliant interaction. However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.

Conclusion: 该方法通过变化感知的传感表示实现了动态威胁的提前规避，证明了在高度动态场景中无需复杂物体建模的有效性。

Abstract: Challenges in traversing dynamic clutters lie mainly in the efficient perception of the environmental dynamics and the generation of evasive behaviors considering obstacle movement. Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.

Conclusion: 机器人元认知通过置信度评估显著改善了决策质量，为未来机器人智能发展提供了重要方向和应用前景。

Abstract: Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.

Motivation: 移动机器人操纵器由于非线性动力学、欠驱动特性以及基座与操纵器子系统间的耦合，存在显著的控制挑战，需要开发能够处理动态不确定性和外部干扰的鲁棒控制方法。

Method: 设计了一种齐次PID结构，将传统PID增益推广为非线性、状态相关的函数，采用分级齐次性方法改进跟踪误差的收敛性，并使用Lyapunov方法进行稳定性分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强下一代移动操纵系统在结构化和非结构化环境中的自主性和可靠性提供了一个可扩展且分析基础扎实的控制框架。

Abstract: Mobile robotic manipulators (MRMs), which integrate mobility and manipulation capabilities, present significant control challenges due to their nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and coupling between the base and manipulator subsystems. This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties. This research contributes a scalable and analytically grounded control framework for enhancing the autonomy and reliability of next-generation mobile manipulation systems in structured and unstructured environments.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理动作无关干扰物方面存在困难，而动作监督的有效性受限于可用动作标签的稀缺性。光流能够自然抑制背景元素并强调运动对象，因此被用作动作驱动信号。

Method: 提出LAOF框架，利用智能体的光流作为伪监督信号来学习对干扰物具有鲁棒性的潜在动作表示，通过光流约束稳定训练过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，LAOF学习的潜在表示在下游模仿学习和强化学习任务中优于现有方法，在极低标签比例条件下显著提升表示质量，即使没有动作监督也能达到或超过使用1%动作标签的监督方法。

Conclusion: 光流约束能够有效稳定训练过程并提高潜在表示质量，在标签稀缺条件下表现出色，为可扩展具身基础模型的预训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning latent actions from large-scale videos is crucial for the pre-training of scalable embodied foundation models, yet existing methods often struggle with action-irrelevant distractors. Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent. Importantly, even without action supervision, LAOF matches or surpasses action-supervised methods trained with 1 percent of action labels.

Result: 在Thingi10k-Val和GPT-3DP-Val基准数据集上的实验表明，SEG在支撑体积减少和可打印性方面显著优于TRELLIS、DPO和DRO等基线模型。

Conclusion: SEG通过在生成过程中直接优化模型，为更可持续和高效的数字制造实践铺平了道路。

Abstract: The transition from digital 3D models to physical objects via 3D printing often requires support structures to prevent overhanging features from collapsing during the fabrication process. While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\textit{\underline{S}upport-\underline{E}ffective \underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures. Our findings highlight the potential of SEG to transform 3D printing by directly optimizing models during the generative process, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient digital fabrication practices.

Abstract: Recent works explore how real and synthetic data contribute to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' generalization. While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $π$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation. It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning. Using the same architecture as $π_0$, we pre-train a model entirely on InternData-A1 and find that it matches the official $π_0$ across 49 simulation tasks, 5 real-world tasks, and 4 long-horizon dexterous tasks. We release the dataset and will open-source the generation pipeline to broaden access to large-scale robotic data and to lower the barrier to scalable data creation for embodied AI research.

Abstract: Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks. Robot rollouts are best viewed on our website: https://aina-robot.github.io.
