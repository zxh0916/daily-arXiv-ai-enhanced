However, the\nrotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion\ncaused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the\nincorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous\nincorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose\nthe Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several\norientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and\nminimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted\naverage mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our\nmain idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local\nconstraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused\nto generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,\nachieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.\nCompared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make\nthe off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean\nspace. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can\nnot only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with\nangular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local\nconstraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller\nacceleration costs."}
