Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios."}

The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence."}

Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space.

We introduce VIRAL, a visual sim-to-real framework that learns humanoid loco-manipulation entirely in simulation and deploys it zero-shot to real hardware. VIRAL follows a teacher-student design: a privileged RL teacher, operating on full state, learns long-horizon loco-manipulation using a delta action space and reference state initialization. A vision-based student policy is then distilled from the teacher via large-scale simulation with tiled rendering, trained with a mixture of online DAgger and behavior cloning. We find that compute scale is critical: scaling simulation to tens of GPUs (up to 64) makes both teacher and student training reliable, while low-compute regimes often fail. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, VIRAL combines large-scale visual domain randomization over lighting, materials, camera parameters, image quality, and sensor delays--with real-to-sim alignment of the dexterous hands and cameras. Deployed on a Unitree G1 humanoid, the resulting RGB-based policy performs continuous loco-manipulation for up to 54 cycles, generalizing to diverse spatial and appearance variations without any real-world fine-tuning, and approaching expert-level teleoperation performance. Extensive ablations dissect the key design choices required to make RGB-based humanoid loco-manipulation work in practice."}

For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems."}

When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance.

We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios.

Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities.

While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition."}

The proposed method uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm that explores the search space to find positions for performing the trajectory. An $α$-shape algorithm is then used to draw the borders of the feasibility areas, and the largest circle inscribed is calculated from the Voronoi diagrams. The aim of this approach is to provide a robustness criterion in the context of robot placement inaccuracies that may be encountered, for example, if the robot is placed on a mobile base when the system is deployed by an operator. The approach developed uses an inverse kinematics model to evaluate all initial configurations, then moves the robot end-effector along the reference trajectory using the Jacobian matrix and assigns a score to the attempt. For the Fanuc CRX10iA/L robot, there can be up to 16 solutions to the inverse kinematics model. The calculation of these solutions is not trivial and requires a specific study that planning tools such as MoveIt cannot fully take into account. Additionally, the optimization process must consider constraints such as joint limits, singularities, and workspace limitations to ensure feasible and efficient trajectory execution."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses).

It starts with a novel energy injection technique to identify passive motion patterns by harnessing the system's natural dynamics. This enables the discovery of passive solutions even in systems with energy dissipation caused by factors such as friction or plastic collisions. Building on these passive solutions, we then employ a continuation approach to derive energy-optimal control inputs for the fully actuated, dissipative robotic system.

Stilwell", "James McMahon"], "title": "Decentralized Gaussian Process Classification and an Application in Subsea Robotics", "comment": "8 pages, 8 figures, IROS 2025 conference", "summary": "Teams of cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on acoustic communication for coordination, yet this communication medium is constrained by limited range, multi-path effects, and low bandwidth. One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments."}

Under review", "summary": "Catching fast-moving objects serves as a benchmark for robotic agility, posing significant coordination challenges for cooperative manipulator systems holding a catcher, particularly due to inherent closed-chain constraints. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner that bridges high-level interception planning with real-time joint space control, enabling dynamic object interception for systems comprising two cooperating arms. We introduce an Adaptive- Terminal (AT) MPC formulation featuring cost shaping, which contrasts with a simpler Primitive-Terminal (PT) approach relying heavily on terminal penalties for rapid convergence. The proposed AT formulation is shown to effectively mitigate issues related to actuator power limit violations frequently encountered with the PT strategy, yielding trajectories and significantly reduced control effort. Experimental results on a robotic platform with two cooperative arms, demonstrating excellent real time performance, with an average planner cycle computation time of approximately 19 ms-less than half the 40 ms system sampling time. These results indicate that the AT formulation achieves significantly improved motion quality and robustness with minimal computational overhead compared to the PT baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic, cooperative interception tasks."}

However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP's strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness."}
