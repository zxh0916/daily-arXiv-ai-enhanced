The designs\nof these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by\nsoft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory\nalloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable\nfor microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures\nfor trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics\nand magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.\nIn the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the\nnotion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization\nusing a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and\ncycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and\n2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail\npropulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test\nmeans of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the\nfirst measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale\npropulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient\nmicrorobotic propulsion."}

Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar\nenergy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,\nEBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior\nunder distribution shifts."}

The framework\nintegrates off-the-shelf models, combining multimodal perception from\nfoundation models with a general-purpose reasoning model capable of robust task\nsequencing. Scene graphs, dynamically maintained within the framework, provide\nspatial awareness and enable consistent reasoning about the environment. The\nframework is evaluated through a series of tabletop robotic manipulation\nexperiments, and the results highlight its potential for building robotic\nmanipulation systems directly on top of off-the-shelf foundation models."}

Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are\nmostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing\nefforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to\nreplicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we\nintroduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,\nrealized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed\nnetwork of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to\nintelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing\nstates that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating\nrich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly\ntransition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances\ngeneralization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and\nscales (up to 10$\\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities\nsuch as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,\neasy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with\nintegrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels\nof dexterity in robotic manipulation."}
