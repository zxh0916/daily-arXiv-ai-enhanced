Conventional landmark-based methods face a\nfundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low\ndistinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult\nstable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's\nnature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the \"relative\ngeometry\" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes \"Contrastive Learning (CL)\"\napplicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly\ndiscriminative descriptor.

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs\neither require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or\ninject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In\nthis work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that\ninjects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial\nfoundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and\nincludes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for\nhigher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To\npreserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced\nAction Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.\nThese designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation,\nmodality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across\nthree simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive\nbaselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and\nvariations in object scale and height."}

We introduce the concept of a meld to formally define a valid,\nfeedback-linearizable subset of outputs that can be selected from a larger deck\nof possible outputs. The main contribution is a formal proof establishing that\nunder suitable dwell-time and compatibility conditions, it is possible to\nswitch between different melds while guaranteeing the uniform boundedness of\nthe system state. We further show that the error dynamics of the active outputs\nremain exponentially stable within each switching interval and that outputs\ncommon to consecutive melds are tracked seamlessly through transitions. The\nproposed theory is valid for any feedback linearizable nonlinear system, such\nas, e.g., robots, aerial and terrestrial vehicles, etc.. We demonstrate it on a\nsimple numerical simulation of a robotic manipulator."}

Most existing approaches focus\non simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity\nof human body dynamics beyond root motion.

Our approach introduces a novel\ntwist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial\ncontrol input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning\nhorizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both\nsimulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed\nnavigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to\nMAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms.

However, the\nheuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the\ntime-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the\napplication of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal\ntrajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based\non the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The\nintroduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP\n(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local\nconstraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all\nUAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed\nParameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on\nthe spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce\nthe number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented\nto verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two\nrobot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for\nrecycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in\nspecific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order\nfeasibility decisions made by the autonomous system.

Recent embodied systems often adopt a\ndual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System\n1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the\nembodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and\ndecision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation\nof the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution\nsuccess, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete\ndimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of\ncognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For\nplanning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,\nMLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether\npredicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14\nMLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction\ncomprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained\naffordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a\ncomprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the\ndevelopment of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in\nhttps://robo-bench.github.io."}
