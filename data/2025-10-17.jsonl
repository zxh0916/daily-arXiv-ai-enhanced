In restricted\nand complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a\nhigh success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit\naction modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal\naction distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined\nplanner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in\nwhich an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize\nthe diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising\nprocess refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By\nsteering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior\ndistribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed\ninitialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning\nsuccess rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across\nparking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints.

We use differential\nevolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals\nindependently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic\nsurveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information\ngain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We\nsimulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning\npre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing\ncapability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed\nwithin the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and\nfrequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are\ndriven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with\nfailures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of\nthe map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their\nhigher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%\ncompared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from\n1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional\nsensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.\nThese results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic\nphenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the\nenvironment.

A central challenge in this setting is the\ntask of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic\npreferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility\n(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that\nlearns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A\nmulti-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual\ninputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These\nplans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by\na spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses\nguided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision\navoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that\nexpands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates\nby 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning\naccuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across\na wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios."}
