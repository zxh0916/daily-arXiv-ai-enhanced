For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers.

We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction."}

The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and\nincluded as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the\ncoupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal\neffects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived\nusing first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through\nsimulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass\nactuator formulation."}

Previous\nstudies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying\nprinciples with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether\nwhip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features\nobserved in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.\nPlatform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while\nsystematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based\nquantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor\nspeed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus\nreaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than\nexhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus\nreaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of\npropagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding\nmedium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new\nperspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential\nplatform for future hydrodynamic research."}

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an\nabstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics\nproblems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the\ndownward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches\nonly add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search\neffort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the\ncommon-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to\nidentify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix\nthese failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains\nshow that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and\ndomain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,\neliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse\nrange of instances from the broader domain."}
