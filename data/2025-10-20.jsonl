Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)\na brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise\nbrick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled\nvalve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed\nframework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency\ngraph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous\ntask execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and\nsafe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows\nreal-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory\ngeneration ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and\nplacement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system\nthat estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares\noptimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental\ndemonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using\nheterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another\nautonomously applies adhesion material between them.

Fernandez", "Alejandro Suarez", "Anibal Ollero", "Matteo Fumagalli"], "title": "Integration of a Variable Stiffness Link for Long-Reach Aerial Manipulation", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for\nlong-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between\nan aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional\nlong-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit\nprecision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL\nintroduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave\neither as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.\n  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm\nmanipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external\ndisturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying\nthe link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the\nUAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and\naerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional\naccuracy during manipulation phases.\n  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a\ncontrollable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus\non autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative\naerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on\nteleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks."}

Traditional methods depend on\ncostly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image\nnoise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose\na cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and\nvisual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These\ncameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter\nocclusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that\nreconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For\npose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates\nthe system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between\nsimulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the\nalignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing\nimage alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical\nmodel, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,\nwith Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171\nmm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential\nfor reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction."}

We\npresent HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with\nhierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.\nHEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical\nrepresentations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel\ncommunity-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains\nfully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.\nBuilding upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the\nnearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant\ninformation at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that\nconsider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we\nintroduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model\nperformance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding\ntraining objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated\nchallenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better\nscalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while\nachieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over\nstate-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it\nin complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus\nenvironment."}

By decoupling temporal and\nspatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,\nsignificantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from\ndemonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted\nextensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects\nof multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action\ndynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task\nexecution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across\ndynamic and diverse settings.
