In\ncooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects\nthat are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which\nonly requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact\npoints is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this\nselection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially\nwith the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by\nhow humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose\ncombining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search\nto select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for\ncontact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a\nvariety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes.

In addition to the ability to perform daily\nactivities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand\nmanipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning\nbetween different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as\nreorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as\nscrewdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve\nstatic grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many\nmotors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex\nmechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor\nplacement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.\nAlternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning\nto achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation\nbetween precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight\n(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of\nvarious widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success\nrates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks.

However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures\nfrom benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier\nthan existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards\nmore interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos\nare available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website."}
