However, its lack of environmental\ninformation poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative\nNon-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for\nUAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or\nobstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data\nfrom the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the\nquadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based\nmethod enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the\nUGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less\nthan 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable\nenvironments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a\nmodulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV\ncooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time\ntrajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the\nneed for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static\nand dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or\nunknown scenarios."}

While many flavors of the TOP exist\nfor planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate\ntoward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the\nrobots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic\nPrize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the\npresence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy\nconstraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and\nstar graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs\nthat coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a\nrank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal\nRank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in\ntemporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious\nOrdinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's\nsenior-rank opponents.
