However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa"}

Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation.

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively."}

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1."}

To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data."}

Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques.

In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches."}

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames.

To achieve this goal, the use of self-driving vehicles in traffic is envisioned and a roadmap for the certification of self-driving vehicles is aimed to be determined. However, it is still unclear how the basic safety requirements that autonomous vehicles must meet will be verified and certified, and which methods will be used. This paper focuses on the comparative evaluation of the prominent methods planned to be used in the certification process of autonomous vehicles. It examines the prominent methods used in the certification process, develops a pipeline for the certification process of autonomous vehicles, and determines the stages, actors, and areas where the addressed methods can be applied."}

However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation."}

Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/rice.edu/parallelized-planning-control/", "summary": "Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking."}

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions."}

Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning."}

However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks."}
