This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by\nImpact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a\nrobot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our\napproach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from\nanimal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy\nefficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport\n(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure."}
