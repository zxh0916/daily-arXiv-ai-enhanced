Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,\nselected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple\nconfigurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity\nload expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized\nby the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural\nnetwork and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training\nefficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed\napproach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the\nsub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with\nlarger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot\ncollaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and\nrepeatability."}

We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the\nstructure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.\nThen we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first\ndirectly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that\nminimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the\nso-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant\ninformation with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches\nreason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their\nformulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We\nshow that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the\ncontrol enables faster and more accurate task performance and system\nidentification while ensuring stable and efficient control."}

For these so-called pick-and-place\noperations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.\nThese tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore\nminimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses\nthis topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic\nactuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy\nconsumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea\nis to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit\ntheir oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic\npick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is\nderived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is\nformulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are\noptimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not\naccount for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design\nand dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two\n(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The\nresults confirm the validity of this approach."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on static\ntrajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking\nthe real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To\nfacilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation\nbenchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object\ncategories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned\nknowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual\nnavigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path\nanti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns\nmulti-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure\nrepresentation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features\nwithin the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive\nsampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby\nreducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently\noutperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared\nto baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering\nmemory requirements.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation\nin a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)\nalgorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for\nquadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and\ngait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,\nenergy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt\ngait changes.
