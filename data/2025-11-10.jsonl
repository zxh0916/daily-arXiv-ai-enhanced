To address this, we propose a\nSymbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and\nthe apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We\nformalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,\nwhere the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on\ninteraction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution\nto proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.\nTo realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial\nperception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds\nthe models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure\nstability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that\nprevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL\non both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction\nfollowing, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive\ndialogues.

Submitted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research\n  (TMLR)", "summary": "Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific\ndomains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned\nGraph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional\nmesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make\nthem particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate\nsimulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.\nHowever, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step\nobservations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without\nthis information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.\nFurther, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error\nfor long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a\ntrajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our\nmethod enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited\ninitial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize\nmovement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations\nfrom a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive\nMeta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of\nthe runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks."}

However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm\ndemonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial\nadditional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained\nsingle-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic\ncross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,\nTwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained\nsingle-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation\nsettings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model\nwithout requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to\nstate-of-the-art model, $\\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual\ndata and compute cost.

We incorporate\nlimits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space\nobstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the\nmanipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations\nclassified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby\nallowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot\nmanipulator in real-time.

The model permits leg-orientation\ncontrol during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice\ninspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped\nsystems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the\nquadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated\nusing the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the\ndesign specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we\ndemonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its\nability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in\nsensor measurements."}

In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely\non rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision\nresilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in\ncluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed\nmass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce\nFlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.\nWe demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more\ncompliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres\nwith peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3\ng and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate\naccelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.\nSimultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,\nsurviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising\nforces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,\nenabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our\nanalysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77\nN/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,\nsqueezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad\nmodels from 20 to 3000 grams.
