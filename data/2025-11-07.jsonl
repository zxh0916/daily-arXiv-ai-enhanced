Using each\nclass of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies\nfor the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three\nexperiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be\nfeasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model\nof eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a\nreduced-scale physical analog.

Simulation\nprovides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often\nfail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body\ninteractions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that\nconstructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,\nobjects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation\ntasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,\ndemonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world\nexecution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.\nOur results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with\nhigh-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation\nof robotic manipulation policies.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/."}

Karen Liu"], "title": "GentleHumanoid: Learning Upper-body Compliance for Contact-rich Human and Object Interaction", "comment": "Home page: https://gentle-humanoid.axell.top", "summary": "Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where\nsafe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments."}
