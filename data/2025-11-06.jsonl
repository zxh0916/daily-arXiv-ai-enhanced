Unlike on-road applications,\nagricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which\nimposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative\nverification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical\nscenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness\nand consistency.\n  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating\nunambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD\nFramework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental\ndescriptions for autonomous agricultural systems."}

We study the problem for both static and mobile\nintruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,\neven for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our\nattention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods\nbased on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.\nMoreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the\nnumber of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the\nsearch process while considering the geometric properties of the connected\northogonal search area."}

Addressing the dual challenges of\nmaintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse\noutdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a\nrobust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented\naccuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an\ninfrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise\nlocation tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.\nWe employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in\ntangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise\ntrajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for\ntrajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing\nand area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying\nmechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent\nairflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's\ncritical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and\nconsistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's\nrobustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for\nautonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications\nof robotics in creative fields."}

Here,\nthe uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic\nlabels of the environment. For example, the task is \"first go to region 1, then\ngo to region 2\"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known\na priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel\nautomata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed\nto capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is\ndesigned for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm\nutilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical\nresults and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed approach."}

Using the imperfect-information game Geister,\nwe analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay\n(unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based\non these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement\nspeed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two\npresentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results\nindicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays\nan important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances\nthe interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for\ndesigning expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior."}

This work introduces a\nself-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through\ninternal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through\nchambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced\nliquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling\nstable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The\ninternal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping\npressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new\npossibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in\nsoft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific\nsampling and operation in underwater and field environments."}
