We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in\nwhich large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical\ndebate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each\nround, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a\ncontrol agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A\npanel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in\nsimulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through\niterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing\nincreasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and\nspecialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a\nquadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther\nthan the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a\npowerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that\nmulti-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising\nnew paradigm for automated robot design."}

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a\nrepresentation--specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are\nrisk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding\nof the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace\nguidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's\nequation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its\n0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's\nequation to synthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable\nlevels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary\ncondition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define\na safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which,\ngiven a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of\nenvironmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of\nhigher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how\n\\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated\ninto the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware."}

However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N.

However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement."}

The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions.

In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but\noften underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose\nHi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection\nsampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS\nstabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during\nonline fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective\nto provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we\ndevelop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible\nonline human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for\nlearning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two\nembodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich\nmanipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL\nbaselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.\nNotably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by\nreliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better\nperformance."}

Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

Demonstrates a reinforcement learning framework\n  for adaptive tool manipulation with variable-length extensions", "summary": "Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and\nare confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools\nefficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the\ndesired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool\norientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering\nframework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse\nkinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions\nusing tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action\ntrajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired\nskills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive\nexperimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver\ndemonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our\ntrained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our\nmodel achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two\ndistinct tools of different lengths.

To support\nsystematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,\nconfigurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and\nscenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models\nvehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:\nmaximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The\nbenchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and\nvirtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together\nwith a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform\nimportance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These\nobservations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform\ncapability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and\nselection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across\ndiverse platforms and scenarios."}

While several recent works\nhave explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to\nsimplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic\nrepresentations.

Recent works in\ncontinuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to\naddressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline\noperation.

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance."}

However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed.
