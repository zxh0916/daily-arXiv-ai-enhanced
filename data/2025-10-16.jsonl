In contrast, cognitive science suggests that\nchildren develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a\nsmall set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex\nitems.

Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable\ngrasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four\nshape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training\non these \"toys\" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding\nstrong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization\nis an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection\npooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our\nmodel achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,\noutperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more\nin-domain data.

This version includes updated contact\n  information", "summary": "This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that\ncombines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to\nachieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive\nenvelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member\nwith differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling\ncontact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A\ndouble-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during\nconventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to\nwrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or\nthin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,\nminimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its\nown linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force\nanalysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces\nand spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was\nprototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of\napproximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both\nmodes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand\nas a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in\nunstructured environments."}

Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide\nsignificant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between\ntasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,\nbut its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain\ndata efficiency.

In this work, we propose a\nlearning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to\nsimultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal\nrobot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification\nto formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation\nwithout introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.\nOptimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with\nless than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact.

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it\nsurpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided\ntraining as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.\nCode and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1."}
