While\nvisual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally\nintensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance\nCoordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of\nReasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology\nto create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous\npipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By\nfine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial\nreasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary\nWhere2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more\nchallenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that\nperformance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming\nthe CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps\nreveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically\nacross reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a\ntextual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,\nreliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost.

Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections.

The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$.

An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model.
