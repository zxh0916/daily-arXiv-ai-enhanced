While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can\ncapture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify\nits physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by\nproprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped\nrobots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability\nmargins from internal sensing during locomotion.

In\ncontrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,\npartial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer\nbroader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation\nlearning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these\nchallenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement\nlearning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the\nperformance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline\nRL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under\nthe sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,\nsimple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,\nwithout significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening\nthe support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented\nby offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery\nand generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations\nsignificantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies\nare successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that\nthese methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or\nsuboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This\nunderscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data\nfor robust policy learning in robotics."}

In this study, we\npresent an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to\nregulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a\ntendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a\ncrucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic\nhands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise\nmovement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This\nadvanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and\nadjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the\nintentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using\nEuler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and\nexperimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing\nwrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique\nsignificantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more\nnatural and intuitive.

This\nmodular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different\nscales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a\nsystem that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.\nLaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nVLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen\nenvironments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world\ndeployment."}

In robotics,\nVision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving\ncomplex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically\nreadjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we\nintroduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA\nlow-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by\nincluding them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and\ncapabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning\nphase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an\nassessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful\nconclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar\napproaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on\nunstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires\nstructured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate\nLITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that\nuse high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks."}
